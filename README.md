# Etch-a-sketch website

A website that simulates the Etch-a-sketch experience. By default the website loads up a 16x16 Grid. To refresh or change the grid size, there is a button labelled "Grid Size" to do so. The prompt provided will take a single integer argument, and make a square grid with the measurements provided.

(  p.s colours are also randomized for extra fun ;)  )
